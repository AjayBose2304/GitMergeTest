This is a sample Git Repository which I used to implement the merge strategy

* Create a local project and init
   * git init
* Add all the files we need to push
   * git add --all
* Check the status of the files
   * git status
* Commit the changes with the message
  *  git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
* Push the changes to the remote branch
  * git push -u origin main
* To check the branch you are working on
  * git branch
* Create a development branch from main
  * git branch development - creates a new branch locally
  * git checkout development - moves our existing workspace to development
* Make changes to the workspace and push that to the remote
  * git add --all
  * git commit -m 'Initial Development Commit'
  * git push origin development
